## Description
This module we were tasked with creating a password generator that would respond within the parameters you determine though window alerts. You have the choice to include lowercase, uppercase, special and numeric characters all randomly generated to the legnth in which you initially specify. This helps us develop in our future careers by utilizing different parts of JavaScript that require user input including the ```addEventListener``` and ```onClick``` command
