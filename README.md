# Password Generator

In this module we did lots with JavaScript. It was very confusing at first and took me hours to complete. For some reason my GitHub pages is not working so unfortunately when I saved main and root no url came up for me to copy. However, although I was able to get all the code done and working there were lots of new things I picked up, different variations of for loops along with the addeventlisteners were the things I improved on the most, I am still struggling trying to make sense of all the elements and objects. I do have a feeling it will get easier when I see it more and more though. I have followed most the directions given in the read me the only thing that I could see damaging my grade would be the github pages url not being inside of this, the readme. Other than that it was a useful module that taught me just how much basic javascript can do for web developers.
